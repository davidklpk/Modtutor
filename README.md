# Modtutor: A conceptual student monitoring dashboard
An interactive all-in-one dashboard to monitor students' performance from a teacher's perspective, developed as part of the European Project Semester in Fall 22/23 at The Hague University of Applied Sciences.

## Goal
The goal of the project was to create a student monitoring dashboard to improve the experience of teachers and students while assessing progress. Therefore, the aim is to help teachers evaluate the performance of their students by offering meaningful insights into their attendance, grades, and assignments. The Hague University of Applied Sciences is currently using different tools like OSIRIS, Brightspace, and Feedbackfruits to assess student performance. 
Several stakeholders would rather count on a new dashboard that serves teachers and students more efficiently than the previous ones.
